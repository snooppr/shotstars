## Shotstars

********
**v2.5**
********

— New functionality added: added time graphs to HTML/CLI reports on new and gone stars,
(Shotstars for OS Windows does not create graphs in CLI, old console), issues/4.

— The cross-users metric in the CLI has been reduced from 10 users to 5.

— Forced use of code page "65001" on Windows OS.
=================================================================================================

********
**v2.4**
********

— Fixed: Image loss in report for OS Windows. Image is no longer scaled.

— New functionality added: Shotstars finds users that overlap with Github projects, including 
those with hidden/private profiles. In the CLI report, a maximum of 20 intersecting usernames 
are recorded, in the HTML report, all intersecting users are recorded. (issues/2).
=================================================================================================

********
**v2.3**
********

— Parallel requests have been unified for all OS, threads are used everywhere instead of 
processes (main reason: instability of processes on different versions of macOS).
  
— Added a notification linking to the Readme on how to get a free token to bypass the limit.
=================================================================================================

*************
**v1.1-v2.1**
*************

— Added support for python 3.14.

— Library versions (dependencies) are weakened.

— Changed the format of the "scan history" table: added a "stars" column. Backup of user git/url
was made and a notification to the user was added.

— Added, the "scan history" table is displayed differently, on Desktop it is normal, on Android
it is compact (due to the small size of the terminal on gadgets).

— Added parameters to CLI and HTML reports: repository size and date of last repo update.
Added smileys to HTML reports.

— Removed previous versions in PyPi, multiplied due to the fact that even minor edits required
increasing the version of the utility (PyPi requirements).

— Shotstars versions have been compiled for Windows, GNU/Linux, Android/Termux_arm/aarch,
which do not require Python and dependencies, i.e. work out of the box.

— Added support (experimental) for OS macOS.
=================================================================================================

********
**v1.1**
********

— Added 'Yoomoney' donation page.
=================================================================================================

********
**v1.0**
********

— The contents of the history table on compressed small-sized terminals, such as Android/Termux, 
  are now not cut off, but are wrapped to a new line.

— From the table of scan history, the names of repositories are highlighted from the most rules,
  convenient for quick reading.
=================================================================================================

********
**v0.5**
********

— Added scan history and selection from it by url - numbers. History is sorted from the beginning
  of the table i.e. the most frequently scanned repositories are at the very top, very convenient.
  To call history, instead of url, enter the keyword 'his/history' (issues/5).
=================================================================================================

********
**v0.4**
********

— Fixed a bug added in v0.3, when encountering a limit without using a token, Shotstars displayed
  incorrect results for stars, and could not stop the software in time.
  
— Typos/spelling corrected.

— Added a notification about the lack of token usage in the limit alert if the github token
  is not used.
=================================================================================================

********
**v0.3**
********

— The elapsed time in days is added to the date of the last repository scan.

— A check has been added to the check for an invalid url/repository, 
  the purpose of which is not to delete the results of scanning the old repository if the name 
  of a valid and invalid project intersect.

— Added the ability to bypass restrictions on scanning a repository with more than 6K+ stars
  (requires obtaining a free github-token).

— Added notification about the use/absence of a github token.
=================================================================================================

********
**v0.2**
********

— You can install the Shotstars package using pip ($ pip install shotstars).

— The script's operation has been accelerated several times due to task parallelization.

— An title metric has been added to the html-report:
  accumulation of “Gone Stars/Dates” for the entire time of scans.

— Changed the appearance of CLI tables. In CLI, the estimated waiting time in minutes has been 
  added to the limit removal date/time. Updated the progress function. The appearance of the html
  report has been redesigned.
  
— Expanded checking for URL input errors, for example, if the user specified a non-existent or
  deleted repository for parsing or tried to scan a repository with more than 6K+ stars, etc.

— Added new functionality to the html report: display of accumulated data for all "new/gone stars"
  broken down by dates; summary calculation of "new/gone stars/date" in the header; and most 
  importantly, a count of duplicate "usernames" that have repeatedly added or removed stars in the
  monitored repository is kept.

— Added a new metric: the real date of creation of the project (sometimes the date of creation of 
  the project can be faked using commits, deceiving users, Shotstars cannot be deceived).
  The html report also added: rating; the real date of creation of the project and description of 
  the project (if present).
  
— Added random "User-Agent" for http requests.

— In case of using old version of Python3.7 on OS Android/Termux or due to limitations of 
  new versions of OS Android fast processes are replaced by safe slow threads.
=================================================================================================

********
**v0.1**
********

— Collected ready-made “shotstars” assemblies for OS GNU/Linux; OS Windows; OS Android (Termux),
  i.e. no libs or Python required.

— Parsing user's stars with checking for errors and restrictions.

— Session support; correct software stop (ctrl +c); some decorations (progress, CLI zebra tables)

— Reports in CLI and HTML formats, including date calculations.

— Support for simulating results, a documented software hack - or a side feature designed to test
  the script on dead/stable repositories without star movement.
