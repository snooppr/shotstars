## Shotstars

********
**v3.8**
********

— Added new metric "Distribution-of-stars-by-month"
(breakdown of all stars by month based on quartiles, can also display separately the number of
private stars).
=================================================================================================

********
**v3.7**
********

— Added new metric: Longest-period-without-add-stars
(date range and duration in days).

— Added new metric: Average-change-in-fact
(Unlike the calculated median, the new metric is measured in times and takes into account 
fluctuations in stars, i.e. "Median-percentage-change" displays the average trend in percentages,
while "Average-change-in-fact" displays the average value in fact in times).

— Added data in json format: {date: all users who put stars}.
(For example, on the graph you can find abnormal spikes in the growth of stars, sometimes these
are fake stars, and instantly check any such peak by opening json and going to the date,
getting the url - a list of users).

— The file "stars.jpg", which is the background for the report, is no longer copied to each new
directory of the scanned project. The file is now created once for all projects,
a small saving of disk space.
=================================================================================================

********
**v3.3**
********

— All statistics are now calculated if the repository is more than 2 months old (previously,
it was only calculated if the repository was more than a year old).

— The-trend-of-adding-stars algorithm has been corrected 
(taking into account days without star movement).

— A new metric has been added to CLI/HTML reports: 'Median-percentage-change
(adding stars in the previous month compared to the month before last)'. 
Algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_change Dynamics are measured in % 
(the ratio of adding stars (based on the median) from the month before last to the last month).
For example, in January the adding of stars was (outliers, fake stars are not taken into account, 
median) 5 stars / day, in February 10 stars / day, then the metric will show +100%. If the 
dynamics are negative, January - 10 stars / day, February - 5 stars / day, then the metric will 
show (-50%), this is not an error, because it is not measured in times, 
check (10 = 100%, 5 = x, x = (5 * 100/10) - 100).

— Added new metric: "Most-of-stars-month / Smallest-of-stars-month", which displays the names of
the months (in which months the most and least stars were received).

— Minor visual edits to the HTML report.
=================================================================================================

********
**v3.2**
********

— Added HTML graph: cumulative star set.

— Minor edits.
=================================================================================================

********
**v3.1**
********

— Updated graph formats: from linear to graphs with vertical lines
(for better interpretation of results, for example, displaying days when the stars were at zero).
In the HTML graph, the marker has been given captions: date and number of stars. The blue color
of the stars on the CLI chart has been changed to light blue (for better visibility). The Y/star
count scale in the CLI now accepts strictly integers (previously they could be fractional).
Added chart captions to CLI.

— Metrics have been expanded: Aggressive-marketing ('Hard+') and 
Fake-stars ('Multiple attempts to promote fake stars').

— Renamed metric: 'fuck-stars' to 'fake-stars'.
=================================================================================================

********
**v3.0**
********

— New metrics/algorithms have been added to CLI/HTML reports: date and maximum number of stars 
received by the repository per day (stars/date); current trend of adding stars (stars/day);
aggressive marketing (—, Low/Medium/High/Hard); fake stars (Yes/—).

— The algorithm for plotting the star addition graph in CLI/HTML reports has been changed: 
instead of calculating user activity, pure parsing is used, which allows finding repositories 
with fake stars. The algorithm for deleting gone stars is the same: 
based on the user's scan frequency activity.
=================================================================================================

********
**v2.7**
********

— The algorithm for counting cross-users has been fixed
(previously, all possible intersections in scanned repositories were counted, now only users 
relative to the selected, scanned repository are counted, Information about repositories has 
been added to the CLI panel and HTML report).

— Added a notification to the CLI that report.html is not generated if Shotstars did not detect 
any star movement, i.e. no stars were added or subtracted.

— Removed duplicate hint in Russian.
=================================================================================================

********
**v2.6**
********

— New functionality added: added time graphs to HTML/CLI reports on new and gone stars,
(Shotstars for OS Windows does not create graphs in CLI, old console), issues/4.

— The cross-users metric in the CLI has been reduced from 10 users to 5.

— Forced use of code page "65001" on Windows OS.
=================================================================================================

********
**v2.4**
********

— Fixed: Image loss in report for OS Windows. Image is no longer scaled.

— New functionality added: Shotstars finds users that overlap with Github projects, including 
those with hidden/private profiles. In the CLI report, a maximum of 20 intersecting usernames 
are recorded, in the HTML report, all intersecting users are recorded. (issues/2).
=================================================================================================

********
**v2.3**
********

— Parallel requests have been unified for all OS, threads are used everywhere instead of 
processes (main reason: instability of processes on different versions of macOS).
  
— Added a notification linking to the Readme on how to get a free token to bypass the limit.
=================================================================================================

*************
**v1.1-v2.1**
*************

— Added support for python 3.14.

— Library versions (dependencies) are weakened.

— Changed the format of the "scan history" table: added a "stars" column. Backup of user git/url
was made and a notification to the user was added.

— Added, the "scan history" table is displayed differently, on Desktop it is normal, on Android
it is compact (due to the small size of the terminal on gadgets).

— Added parameters to CLI and HTML reports: repository size and date of last repo update.
Added smileys to HTML reports.

— Removed previous versions in PyPi, multiplied due to the fact that even minor edits required
increasing the version of the utility (PyPi requirements).

— Shotstars versions have been compiled for Windows, GNU/Linux, Android/Termux_arm/aarch,
which do not require Python and dependencies, i.e. work out of the box.

— Added support (experimental) for OS macOS.
=================================================================================================

********
**v1.1**
********

— Added 'Yoomoney' donation page.
=================================================================================================

********
**v1.0**
********

— The contents of the history table on compressed small-sized terminals, such as Android/Termux, 
  are now not cut off, but are wrapped to a new line.

— From the table of scan history, the names of repositories are highlighted from the most rules,
  convenient for quick reading.
=================================================================================================

********
**v0.5**
********

— Added scan history and selection from it by url - numbers. History is sorted from the beginning
  of the table i.e. the most frequently scanned repositories are at the very top, very convenient.
  To call history, instead of url, enter the keyword 'his/history' (issues/5).
=================================================================================================

********
**v0.4**
********

— Fixed a bug added in v0.3, when encountering a limit without using a token, Shotstars displayed
  incorrect results for stars, and could not stop the software in time.
  
— Typos/spelling corrected.

— Added a notification about the lack of token usage in the limit alert if the github token
  is not used.
=================================================================================================

********
**v0.3**
********

— The elapsed time in days is added to the date of the last repository scan.

— A check has been added to the check for an invalid url/repository, 
  the purpose of which is not to delete the results of scanning the old repository if the name 
  of a valid and invalid project intersect.

— Added the ability to bypass restrictions on scanning a repository with more than 6K+ stars
  (requires obtaining a free github-token).

— Added notification about the use/absence of a github token.
=================================================================================================

********
**v0.2**
********

— You can install the Shotstars package using pip ($ pip install shotstars).

— The script's operation has been accelerated several times due to task parallelization.

— An title metric has been added to the html-report:
  accumulation of “Gone Stars/Dates” for the entire time of scans.

— Changed the appearance of CLI tables. In CLI, the estimated waiting time in minutes has been 
  added to the limit removal date/time. Updated the progress function. The appearance of the html
  report has been redesigned.
  
— Expanded checking for URL input errors, for example, if the user specified a non-existent or
  deleted repository for parsing or tried to scan a repository with more than 6K+ stars, etc.

— Added new functionality to the html report: display of accumulated data for all "new/gone stars"
  broken down by dates; summary calculation of "new/gone stars/date" in the header; and most 
  importantly, a count of duplicate "usernames" that have repeatedly added or removed stars in the
  monitored repository is kept.

— Added a new metric: the real date of creation of the project (sometimes the date of creation of 
  the project can be faked using commits, deceiving users, Shotstars cannot be deceived).
  The html report also added: rating; the real date of creation of the project and description of 
  the project (if present).
  
— Added random "User-Agent" for http requests.

— In case of using old version of Python3.7 on OS Android/Termux or due to limitations of 
  new versions of OS Android fast processes are replaced by safe slow threads.
=================================================================================================

********
**v0.1**
********

— Collected ready-made “shotstars” assemblies for OS GNU/Linux; OS Windows; OS Android (Termux),
  i.e. no libs or Python required.

— Parsing user's stars with checking for errors and restrictions.

— Session support; correct software stop (ctrl +c); some decorations (progress, CLI zebra tables)

— Reports in CLI and HTML formats, including date calculations.

— Support for simulating results, a documented software hack - or a side feature designed to test
  the script on dead/stable repositories without star movement.
