A tool to track waning stars on Github.

The purpose of the ‚Äúshotstars‚Äù script is to find accounts from which they once gave stars to repositories,  
but then they were removed and provide such an analysis in a human-readable form (it doesn‚Äôt matter,  
you can scan both your own and other people‚Äôs projects), as a result, try to do what it doesn‚Äôt do Github by default.  
The secondary function of the software is to monitor the thrown stars also at a selected period of time.

"shotstars" supports simulation of results. To simulate the process, the user must scan the new repository once,   
adding it to the database; randomly delete and add any lines to a file (OS GNU/Linux and Termux)  
`/home/{user}/ShotStars/results/{repo}/new.txt`  
(OS Windows)  
`C:\Users\{User}\AppData\Local\ShotStars\result\{repo}\new.txt`;  
run a second scan of the same repository.
