# shotstars
A tool to track waning stars on Github.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>Github does not provide users with statistics on disappearing stars in the repository. "shotstars" is trying to resolve this issue and provide such information to the user.

The purpose of the “shotstars” script is to find accounts from which they once gave stars to repositories,  
but then they were removed and provide such an analysis in a human-readable form (it doesn’t matter,  
you can scan both your own and other people’s projects), as a result, try to do what it doesn’t do Github by default.  
The secondary function of the software is to monitor the thrown stars also at a selected period of time.  

**Native Installation**  
```
pip install requests rich
python shot_stars.py
```

**Ready-made builds are provided for OS GNU/Linux & Windows & Termux (Python is not required)**

"shotstars" supports simulation of results. To simulate the process, the user must scan the new repository once,   
adding it to the database; randomly delete and add any lines to a file (OS GNU/Linux and Termux)  
`/home/{user}/ShotStars/results/{repo}/new.txt`  
(OS Windows)  
`C:\Users\{User}\AppData\Local\ShotStars\result\{repo}\new.txt`;  
run a second scan of the same repository.

## TL;DR  
Github не предоставляет пользователям статистику по исчезающим звездам в репозитории. "shotstars" пытается решить этот вопрос и предоставить такую информацию пользователю.
